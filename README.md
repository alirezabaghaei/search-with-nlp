Search with NLP
This project demonstrates how to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks to search through PDF documents. The workflow includes installing necessary packages, processing documents, and applying NLP techniques for searching within the content.

##Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

PyPDF2: For handling and extracting text from PDF files.
sentence_transformers: Used to transform and analyze sentences for semantic search.
You can install these packages by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install PyPDF2
pip install sentence_transformers
Project Overview
Install Packages: First, ensure that the required Python packages (PyPDF2 and sentence_transformers) are installed.

Download PDF Data: The project includes code for downloading or loading PDFs. You can uncomment and modify the section to point to your specific PDF directory.

Process PDF Files: Using PyPDF2, the project extracts text from the provided PDFs.

NLP Search: Using sentence_transformers, the extracted text is transformed for semantic search, allowing more intelligent queries based on meaning rather than keyword matching.

Running the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
cd your_repo
Install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add your PDF files to the appropriate folder or update the paths in the code.

Run the Jupyter Notebook to process the PDFs and conduct searches.

Usage
Modify the download data section to load or download your desired PDF documents.
Use the provided NLP models to conduct semantic searches across the PDF content.
